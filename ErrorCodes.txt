  fenEPSquareInvalid    fenEP
  fenEPSquareUnclear    fenEP [This is where it is not known which player is
                        next to play, so the quoted EP square cannot be
                        confirmed]

NB
1.  the fen elements fenHalfMoveClock and fenMoveCounter should never be
    'unknown' as the program resets these to 0 and 1 respectively if there
    is an error in the original fen
2.  the fenBoard element should never be set to 'unknown' abut the error
    identification system provides more detailed identification and it
    is not expected that fenBoard will be over-written but only corrected
