This is a project intended primarily to enable me to learn
python 3 and to apply this to a chess program.

For more details refer to the journal.txt file.

At his stage I do not believe the project will be useful for
others as:-
   1 I do not understand Python 3 to ant great extent so others
     should ignore or laugh at my programming efforts (as they
     feel appropriate).
   2 I am a 'poor to average' chess player so my ideas about
     chess should definitely be laughed at! (As my results attest)

This program is written in Python 3 and uses the excellent python
chess library. To run the program you need to install this Python
package.
