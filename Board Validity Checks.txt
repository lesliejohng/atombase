The validity tests I will use are:-
  Are there exactly one king for each side on the board?
  Is the opponent in check?
    If so then the position is invalid. The opponent has not played
    a move to get himself out of check or has played a move which has
    put himself in check.
  Are there less than 9 White Pawns and 9 Black Pawns on the board?
  Are there less than 17 White Pieces and 17 Black Pieces on the Board?
  Is the total of pawns and queens for each side less that 10?
  Does each side have a maximum of one white-squared and black-squared
    Bishop?
      This might be possible if one of the sides under-promoted to
      a Bishop, but this is unlikely.
  Are there any Pawns on the 1st or 8th Rank of the Board?

I will use the fen to undertake this check and will additionally
undertake the following checks

  that all characters in the board string are valid ENGLISH piece
  representations (i.e. kqrbnpKQRBNP) numbers are ignored in this
  check

  that exactly of 64 positions have been defined in the board element
    of the fen string

  that where there are 8 ranks defined
    1 each board rank (between the '/' symbols) adds up to 8 squares
    2 that numbers in the board element of fen range 1 to 8

  that ep indicators are consistent with pawn positions

  that castling rights are consistent with King and Rook positions

  that the half-move clock are consistent with move number

  NB
  *Python chess has strong move validation, so this check only has to
  be performed on the initial position*
