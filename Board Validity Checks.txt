The validity tests I will use are:-
  Are there exactly one king for each side on the board?
  Is the opponent in check?
    If so then the position is invalid. The opponent has not played
    a move to get himself out of check or has played a move which has
    put himself in check.
  Are there less than 9 White Pawns and 9 Black Pawns on the board?
  Are there less than 17 White Pieces and 17 Black Pieces on the Board?
  Is the total of pawns and queens for each side less that 10?
  Does each side have a maximum of one white-squared and black-squared
    Bishop?
      This might be possible if one of the sides under-promoted to
      a Bishop, but this is unlikely.
  Are there any Pawns on the 1st or 8th Rank of the Board?
