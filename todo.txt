As for the external setting of variables I need to decide which are
'protected' and change their names accordingly.

I need to move back from the idea of the fenElementDict, as this creates
a readability issue: make dictionary calls variables again.
use Find> Replace All for this

Again readability move 'main processing routines' from __init__ to separate
method

Continue annotation of positionValidity.py

*********************************************************************

Other changes

Add recognition of 50 move rule in checking of fenHalfMoveClock

consider whether I was right to make each of the input methods a
@staticmethod
