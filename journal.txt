I will write a chess program based on python chess which encapsulates my ideas
about chess. This is for the challenge of clear thinking and I have no initial
plans to make this a commercial success or even to make it useful for others.

My approach will be based on a well-respected thinking method based on a the
approach used by Karpov. I am using this because it makes sense to me and
the system is described well in the book 'finding the right plan'.

Python chess has a number of features which I will use to create the required
program. I will need to learn python on the fly, so don't look to the code as
an example. I confident that I can get some of my ideas working, but don't
expect my approach to be "pythonic"!

I added a README file and a LICENCE file, basing the licence on the MIT open
licence. Added an 'import' file to import the chess module from Python Chess.
Tested and committed changes.

review- the use of a import file is probably unnecessary and confusing better
to import where needed in individual files. There appears to be no problem
in Python over duplicate imports.

In establishing a chess program I wish to use my own ideas. I have read up on
the approaches used by others, but feel you can only do something valuable if
you do it differently.

So: What is my aim and what will be my approach?

My aim...

There are many 'playing' programs, so this will not be one more.. Instead I
want a program which will take a position and identify to important features
of that position. The aim is to guide a human player.

My approach...

These have not been fully clarified in my mind, but my main ideas are:-

1 That in order to identify the elements in a position that position must be
  'settled'. My initial idea is to explore a position initially and produce
  an array of the likely derived positions and to analyse each of these.

2 The position analysis will be based on the Karpov approach

3 The positions will display with some type of prompt showing the elements
  in a verbal form.
