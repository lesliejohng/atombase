I will write a chess program based on python chess which encapsulates my ideas
about chess. This is for the challenge of clear thinking and I have no initial
plans to make this a commercial success or even to make it useful for others.

My approach will be based on a well-respected thinking method based on a the
approach used by Karpov. I am using this because it makes sense to me and
the system is described well in the book 'finding the right plan'.

Python chess has a number of features which I will use to create the required
program. I will need to learn python on the fly, so don't look to the code as
an example. I confident that I can get some of my ideas working, but don't
expect my approach to be "pythonic"!

I added a README file and a LICENCE file, basing the licence on the MIT open
licence. Added an 'import' file to import the chess module from Python Chess.
Tested and committed changes.
